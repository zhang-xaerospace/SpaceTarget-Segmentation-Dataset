# SpaceTarget-InstanceSegmentation-Dateset
This repository provides the code and dataset for running space target inference using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Object Detection Prompt. The included resources support high-quality and accurate instance segmentation, expanding beyond pose estimation tasks to include instance segmentation for space target images.

## Experiment Results
Below are some examples of the experiment results:
